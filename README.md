# Data Structure Implementations in C

This repository contains implementations of data structures in C. The project is organized into the following directories:

- `lib`: Contains common utility functions and header files.
- `student_sort`: Storing student datas in a linked list implemented stack and sort the students for a chosen part of proporties.
- `imp2`: Not added yet.


## Directory Structure

```plaintext
data_structure_imps_c/
|-- lib/
|   |-- linked.C
|   |-- linked.h
|   |-- stack.C
|   |-- stack.h
|-- student_sort/
|   |-- main.c
|   |-- Makefile
|-- imp2/
|   |-- main.c
|   |-- Makefile
```


## Building and Running the Project
To build the project, navigate to the desired implementation directory (student_sort or imp2) and use the `make` command. Now you can run the executable program in same folder.
