# Data Structure Implementations in C

This repository contains implementations of data structures in C. The project is organized into the following directories:

- `lib`: Contains common utility functions and header files.
- `imp1`: An implementation that utilizes a linked list to store a 2-D matrix. Each node in the linked list has two pointers.
- `imp2`: Storing student datas in a linked list implemented stack and sort the students for a chosen part of proporties.
